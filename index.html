            <h2>Plant a tree, so that the next generation can get air for free.
            </h2>
            Trees are vital for this planet as they give us oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, stabilize the soil and
            give
            life to the world’s wildlife.
            They also provide us with the materials for tools and shelter. Despite their importance, human beings
            are
            cutting them down for their worldly needs. This has to be minimized because
            our life is not possible without trees. Instead of cutting them, we should grow more trees.</p>

            Till date, our group has put in whatever little money we had, for day to day expenses, from our earnings.
            Our team is mostly comprised of working people and ever since the COVID-19
            pandemic hit us, most of us have lost our jobs and some of us are facing major pay cuts.</p>

            <h2>Donate for Women Education</h2>India's female literacy has gone up but still 22 percentage points behind
            world average; education among young women. Women education in India plays a very important role in the
            overall development of the country. It not only helps in the development of half of the human resources, but
            in improving the quality of life at home and outside. 1 If it is said that education is the key to all
            problems, then it won't be improper.</p>
